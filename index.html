<p>RPG Maker Body of Knowedge: collective tips for making awesome RPG Makers games</p>

<p>It takes a lot of work to make a polished, unique RPG Maker game. But, this makes your game stand out of the hordes that make it to the web, and the dozens on Steam.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Create memorable characters.</strong> Use <a href="http://www.rpgalchemy.com/how-to-make-memorable-player-characters-in-thirty-minutes-or-less/">this excellent guide</a> to create really memorable characters -- at least for your main hero/villan.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create a unqiue universe.</strong> Every fantasy/sci-fi games (and even some modern ones) use elements that are unique to their in-game universe. Create some of these, even if they're simple (eg. talking pet avatars that reflect each human's personality) and don't affect the plot much.</li>
<li>
<strong>Create a custom protagonist sprite.</strong> The player sees this character the most. Don't use standard RPG ones. Generator ones are okay in a pinch. </li>
<li>
<strong>Customize your game with scripts.</strong> There are hundreds of free, quality scripts you can use to modify all aspects of your game (and writing your own is not terribly difficult). Use this to create interesting combinations and unique gameplay elements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Customize the message window.</strong> Changing the colour is good. Changing the border too is even better.</li>
<li>
<strong>Change the font.</strong> This gives the entire game a different feel.</li>
<li>
<strong>Avoid using RTP assets.</strong> These are usually polished, but severely overused across games. Main characters, villans, monsters, tiles, sound effects, maps, change anything you can. Slight modifications are good (eg. edit a generated hero and add customize their hair/clothes a bit) if you can't make brand-new art.  There are <em>tons of free assets</em> out on the internet that you can legally use.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use small, new art, everywhere.</strong> Create, say, a flower or two, and use those instead of (or alongside) the standard 2-3 that the RTP includes. This can also give your game a unique theme.</li>

<strong>Use <a href="http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/">ResHacker</a> to add a custom icon to your final executable.</strong> This is <a href="http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/11436-replacing-the-game-icon/#comment-117318">officially sanctioned</a>.</li>
