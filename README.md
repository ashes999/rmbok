RPG Maker Body of Knowedge: collective tips for making awesome RPG Makers games

It takes a lot of work to make a polished, unique RPG Maker game. But, this makes your game stand out of the hordes that make it to the web, and the dozens on Steam.

# Regardless of RPG Maker Type

- **Create memorable characters.** Use [this excellent guide](http://www.rpgalchemy.com/how-to-make-memorable-player-characters-in-thirty-minutes-or-less/) to create really memorable characters -- at least for your main hero/villan.
- **Create a custom protagonist sprite.** The player sees this character the most. Don't use standard RPG ones. Generator ones are okay in a pinch. 
- **Use [ResHacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) to add a custom icon to your final executable.** This is [officially sanctioned](http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/11436-replacing-the-game-icon/#comment-117318).
- **Customize the message window.** Changing the colour is good. Changing the border too is even better.
- **Change the font.** This gives the entire game a different feel.
- **Avoid using RTP assets.** These are usually polished, but severely overused across games. Main characters, villans, monsters, tiles, sound effects, maps, change anything you can. Slight modifications are good (eg. edit a generated hero and add customize their hair/clothes a bit) if you can't make brand-new art.  There are *tons of free assets* out on the internet that you can legally use.
- **Use small, new art, everywhere.** Create, say, a flower or two, and use those instead of (or alongside) the standard 2-3 that the RTP includes. This can also give your game a unique theme.
